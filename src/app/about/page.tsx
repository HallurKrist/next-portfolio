          <p>
          I am a passionate and skilled game programmer with a strong foundation in game development, quality assurance, and software engineering. I am currently completing a Master‚Äôs degree in Games (Technology Track) at IT University of Copenhagen, graduating in June 2025. I have experience in game programming, AI systems, graphics, and testing methodologies. As a QA intern at SYBO Games, I contributed to the quality and stability of Subway Surfers. I have a keen interest in game design methodologies, and my master‚Äôs thesis explores how early game prototypes can refine both the final game and the development process. I am adept at problem-solving, debugging, and collaborating with multidisciplinary teams. I am now seeking a role as a game programmer/developer or tester where I can apply my technical expertise and analytical skills to innovative projects.
